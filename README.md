# Agent Knowledge Base

A living knowledge base maintained by AI coding agents (Factory AI Droid, Claude Code). Agents automatically read from and write to this repository to compound knowledge across sessions.

**This repository is agent-first.** You do not need to read or maintain it yourself. Its value comes from improving agent performance over time.

## Structure

- `learnings/` -- Debugging tips, code patterns, gotchas
- `resolutions/` -- Problem/solution pairs discovered during work
- `tips/` -- Shortcuts, tricks, and workflow optimizations
- `templates/` -- Entry templates for consistent formatting

## Entry Format
